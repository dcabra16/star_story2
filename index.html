  <!-- Situation -->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2 class="section-title">Situation</h2>
        <p>
            During the IT Department Career Advancement Project, my schedule changed suddenly when I started working full time while also taking classes.
            This made it a lot harder to keep up with the weekly tasks and milestones I had originally planned.
    
        </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Task-->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2 class="section-title">Task</h2>
            <p>My goal was to figure out how to stay on track with the project without getting overwhelmed by the new workload. 
                I needed a way to continue making steady progress even though my time was now more limited.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Action-->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2 class="section-title">Action</h2>
            <p>
            To handle the change, I stepped back and looked at everything I needed to do. I decided which parts of the project were the most important and which ones could be simplified. I reorganized my weekly routine so I had dedicated time for schoolwork around my job schedule. Instead of overthinking every decision, I focused on making practical choices that kept the project moving. I also checked on my progress each week and made small adjustments whenever something wasn’t working.
                When I wasn’t sure what direction to take, I reached out to my instructor and my manager for guidance.    
            </p>
            </div>
            <!-- Result-->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2 class="section-title">Result</h2>
            <p>By changing my approach, I was able to keep the project moving forward and complete the key parts of it, even with my new full-time schedule. 
                This experience helped me improve my time management, prioritize more effectively, and make decisions with more confidence. 
                Most importantly, it strengthened my resiliency. I learned how to adapt when circumstances change and how to stay committed to my goals even when things become challenging. 
                These skills will support me as I continue working toward transitioning into an IT role.</p>
